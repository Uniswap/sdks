# APPROVE Verdict Criteria

**Approve** is your default. Use it when:

- The code works
- You have suggestions but they're improvements, not blockers
- You're uncertain whether something is actually a problem

Approve with comments beats comment-only reviews. If it's not worth blocking, it's worth approving.
