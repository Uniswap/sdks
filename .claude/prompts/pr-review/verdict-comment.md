# COMMENT Verdict Criteria

**Comment** - Rarely. Creates friction without clear signal.

Use COMMENT only when:

- You have questions that need answers before you can form a verdict
- The changes are outside your area of expertise and you want someone else to approve

Prefer APPROVE with comments over COMMENT alone.
