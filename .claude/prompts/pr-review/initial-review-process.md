# Initial Review Process

1. **Read the PR description** - Understand what problem is being solved and why

2. **Scan the diff** - Get an overview of what changed before diving deep

3. **Review in priority order:**
   - Phase 1: Critical issues (bugs, security, performance, data risks)
   - Phase 2: Patterns & principles (maintainability concerns)
   - Phase 3: Polish (naming, coverage, docs - only if win is obvious)

4. **Consider context** - Check if there are existing comments or discussions that provide additional context

5. **Form a verdict** - Based on findings, determine: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT

6. **Write comments** - Be direct, brief, and actionable. One issue per comment.
