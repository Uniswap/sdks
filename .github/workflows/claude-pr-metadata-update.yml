name: "[claude] Generate PR Title & Description"

# Automated PR title and description generation using Claude AI
#
# This workflow automatically generates:
# - Conventional commit-style PR titles based on repository patterns
# - Comprehensive PR descriptions based on recent merged PR templates
#
# Features:
# - Skips rebases (uses patch-ID to detect actual code changes)
# - Learns title patterns from recent commits
# - Learns description templates from recent merged PRs
# - Conventional commit format enforcement
# - Preserves user content outside of marked sections

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]

# Concurrency: Cancel in-flight runs for the same PR
concurrency:
  group: pr-metadata-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  generate-pr-metadata:
    # Skip conditions:
    # - Merge queue PRs (handled separately)
    # - Dependabot PRs (already have proper titles)
    # - Release PRs (have their own format)
