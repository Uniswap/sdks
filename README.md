A repository for many Uniswap SDK's. All SDK's can be found in `sdk/` and have more information in their individual README's.

## Development Commands

```

## Publishing SDK's

Publishing of each SDK is done on merge to main using semantic-release and semantic-release-monorepo. PR titles / commits follow angular conventional commits with custom settings that map as follows:

```markdown
- `fix(SDK name):` will trigger a patch version
- `<type>(public):` will trigger a patch version
- `feat(SDK name):` will trigger a minor version
- `feat(breaking):` will trigger a major version for a breaking change
```

Versions will only be generated based on the changelog of the relevant SDK's folder/files.
