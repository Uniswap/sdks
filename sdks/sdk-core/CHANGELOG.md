# @uniswap/sdk-core

## 7.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 58a58d0: Migrate build system from TSDX to tsc with separate CJS/ESM/types outputs. The new `exports` field ensures correct module resolution for all standard consumers (`import`/`require` of the package root). Deep subpath imports (e.g., `@uniswap/sdk-core/dist/...`) are no longer supported — all public APIs are re-exported from the package entry point. `tslib` is now a runtime dependency (required by `importHelpers`). Minimum Node.js version is now 18.

## 7.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 1779ed4: Test changeset workflow with dummy comment addition
