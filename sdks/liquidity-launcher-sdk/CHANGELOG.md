# @uniswap/liquidity-launcher-sdk

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 208556d: Fix auction duration on Arbitrum-family chains. `BLOCK_TIME_SECONDS_BY_CHAIN` now sets the correct sub-second L2 (`arbBlockNumber`) cadence for Arbitrum One (0.25s) and Robinhood (0.1s); previously both fell back to the 12s default, which compressed an auction's real-time window by ~48x (Arbitrum) and ~120x (Robinhood) because the CCA advances on the L2 block clock, not `block.number`. Robinhood additionally requires the on-chain `blocknumberish` library to recognize its chain id (and a CCA/LBPStrategy redeploy) before the fix takes effect on-chain.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 437605c: Add Avalanche (43114), XLayer (196), and Robinhood Chain (4663) to the supported launch chains, all carrying the canonical uERC20 factory. Robinhood is intentionally omitted from `BLOCK_TIME_SECONDS_BY_CHAIN` — like Arbitrum, its contract-visible `block.number` tracks Ethereum L1 (~12s).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a021251: Add `@uniswap/liquidity-launcher-sdk`: a framework-agnostic toolkit for the Uniswap Liquidity Launcher (CCA + LBP) stack — per-chain addresses, ABIs, struct types, calldata encoders, deterministic-address prediction, auction-configuration math, on-chain read descriptors, fee-tier availability (`getFeeTierAvailability`), a pure transaction assembler (`buildLaunchTransactions`), and liquidity-lock recipients (`buildLockRecipient`: timelock / fees-forwarder / buyback-burn).
